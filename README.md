**IMPORTANT:** New files and edits to existing files should take place only within the assets folder. Files in the dist directory are autmatically generated and will be overwritten when the production task is run. New and existing edits to the HTML files should be done in the html folder inside the assets directory.

1. From the command line, type in `gulp dev` to fire up the Gulp instance. If you get an error, you may need to install Gulp globally. To do this type `npm install gulp -g` into the command line. When this completes, try tying in `gulp dev` into the command line once again.
2. This process should open up a new browser window with your site in it. In the console, you will see both a local and an external URL that your site is available for viewing from.
3. All file edits you make are automatically reflected in any of the browsers that have your project open.
